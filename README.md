# MSS_Wechat

* This project is to do the text analysis on MSS's Wechat Articles since its establishment on July.31, 2023.
* First, it involves web scrapping all those 70 articles from then on and continue to do that once there is any update.
* Second, use an approriate Chiense text analysis package to return all the metrics and categorize articles into certain topics.
* Third, conduct time-series analysis over each topic of articles.
* Further, we compare any search engine keyword trend or stock index trend against the timeline of those articles.
